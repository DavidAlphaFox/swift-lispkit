;;; Plot graphs into a PDF file
;;;
;;; This is a demo of library (lispkit draw). Function `plot` draws a function over
;;; a given range using a number of interpolation points into a given rectangle.
;;; It is used a number of times in function `plot-demo-page` which explains how to
;;; compose drawings and save them in a PDF file.
;;;
;;; Usage: (plot-demo-page "graph-demo.pdf")

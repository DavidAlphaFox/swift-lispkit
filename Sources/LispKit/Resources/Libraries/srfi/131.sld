;;; SRFI 131
;;; ERR5RS Record Syntax (reduced)
;;;
;;; This SRFI is a reduced version of the SRFI 99 syntactic layer that can be
;;; implemented with syntax-rules without requiring low-level macros. Like
;;; SRFI-99's syntax layer, it is backward compatible with the `define-record-type`
;;; macro from SRFI 9 or R7RS-small. It is forward compatible with SRFI 99.

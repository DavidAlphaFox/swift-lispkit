## 0.5 (2016-11-13)
- Implemented environments as first-class values
- Introduced a new R7RS-compatible library abstraction
- Reimplemented all functions using libraries

## 0.4 (2016-09-04)
- Migration from Swift 2.2 to Swift 3.0
- Implemented [R6RS](http://www.r6rs.org)-compliant hash tables
- Implemented [R7RS](http://www.r7rs.org)-compliant parameters (supporting dynamic scoping)

  abstractions) 
- Fixed a few cases where the runtime didn't do proper tail calls
- Implemented full support for `call/cc`

## 0.2 (2016-05-16)
- Revised bytecode instruction set. Added documentation to the
  [LispKit Wiki](https://github.com/objecthub/swift-lispkit/wiki).

- Optimized usage of variables for function arguments.

## 0.1 (2016-05-02)
- Initial version consisting of the framework and a very simple read-eval-print loop
- The LispKit framework implements a subset of the
  [R5RS Scheme standard](http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/); the
  biggest feature missing is support for `call/cc`
- LispKit coonsists of a compiler generating bytecode and a virtual machine which
  interprets the bytecode
- The framework is incomplete and work in progress

## Overview

_LispKit_ is a framework for building Lisp-based extension and scripting languages
for macOS applications. _LispKit_ is fully implemented in the programming language
[Swift](http://www.swift.org). _LispKit_ implements a core language based on the
[R7RS (small) Scheme standard](http://www.r7rs.org). It is extensible,
allowing the inclusion of new native libraries, of new libraries written in Scheme, as
well as custom modifications of the core environment consisting of a compiler, a
virtual machine as well as core libraries.

So far, performance was not a priority in the development of _LispKit_. The _LispKit_
compiler does not perform any code optimizations and the performance of the system is
below state of the art Lisp and Scheme implementations.


## Features

_LispKit_ provides support for the following core features, many of which are based on R7RS:

  - Modules via R7RS libraries
  - Hygienic macros based on the _syntax-rules_ standard
  - First-class environments
  - `call/cc`, `dynamic-wind` and exceptions
  - Dynamically-scoped paramaters
  - Multiple return values
  - Delayed execution via promises and streams
  - Support for the full numerical tower consisting of arbitrary size integers, rationals,
    real numbers, and inexact complex numbers.
  - Unicode strings and characters
  - Vectors and bytevectors
  - Text and binary ports
  - R7RS-compliant records
  - [R6RS](http://www.r6rs.org)-compliant hashtables

_LispKit_ is incompatible or incomplete with respect to the following R7RS features:

  - Lists are immutable. Mutable cons-cells are supported in a way similar to
    [Racket](https://racket-lang.org).
  - R7RS's mechanism for declaring the features of the Scheme implementation is not yet
    implemented; this includes the following functions: `features` and `cond-expand`
  - Error support is incomplete; the following functions are missing: `syntax-error`,
    `read-error?`, `file-error?`
  - `current-input-port`, `current-output-port`, and `current-error-port` are functions
    (as required by R5RS) and not parameter objects (as required by R7RS)
  - The R5RS-fallback mechanism for handling symbols in a case-insensitive manner is not
    implemented yet; this includes support for `include-ci`
  - Libraries do not yet support: `include`, `include-ci`, `include-library-declarations`, and
    `cond-expand`.
  - Environment-support lacks the following functions: `scheme-report-environment`,
    `null-environment`.


## Architecture

From an architectural perspective, _LispKit_ consists of:

1. a compiler translating _LispKit_ expressions into bytecode, and
2. a virtual machine for interpreting the generated bytecode. The virtual machine is
stack-based, handles tail calls and continuations, and provides a garbage collector.

Details can be found in the [LispKit Wiki](https://github.com/objecthub/swift-lispkit/wiki).

The project provides a read-eval-print loop. This is a command-line tool that can be used
to try out and experiment with the framework. The read-eval-print parses
the entered _LispKit_ expression, compiles it to bytecode, executes it, and
displays the result.


## Building and running the read-eval-print loop

First, clone the _LispKit_ repository via `git`. The following command will create a
directory `swift-lispkit`.

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/objecthub/swift-lispkit.git
Cloning into 'swift-lispkit'...
remote: Counting objects: 1849, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (39/39), done.
remote: Total 1849 (delta 9), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 1806
Receiving objects: 100% (1849/1849), 689.43 KiB | 666.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1430/1430), done.
```

Next, fetch dependencies and build them from scratch via `carthage`:
```sh
> cd swift-lispkit
> carthage bootstrap
*** Checking out swift-numberkit at "1.6.0"
*** xcodebuild output can be found in /var/folders/c_/h31lvvtx72s3zhc9bvxd0p480000gn/T/carthage-xcodebuild.46W8Z7.log
*** Building scheme "NumberKit (shared)" in NumberKit.xcodeproj
```

Now, it's possible to switch to Xcode and build the read-eval-print loop via
scheme `LispKitRepl`:
```sh
> open LispKit.xcodeproj
```

## Requirements
